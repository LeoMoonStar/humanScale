# PeopleCoin Monorepo

This repository hosts the code for the PeopleCoin platform, organized as a monorepo.

## Directory Structure

We use a clear separation of concerns:

- **`apps/frontend`**: The user-facing web application (Mobile-First / Responsive).
- **`backend`**: The off-chain API service (Rust/Golang) for profiles and media.
- **`contracts`**: SUI Move Smart Contracts.
- **`market-maker`**: (Optional) Automated bot for liquidity management.

## Getting Started

### Frontend
Navigate to `apps/frontend` to work on the UI.
